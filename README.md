# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
This Handwriting Recognition System uses a CNN trained on the MNIST dataset to identify handwritten digits. It processes images by converting to grayscale, applying thresholding, and resizing. Deployed via a Flask API, users can upload images and receive digit predictions.
