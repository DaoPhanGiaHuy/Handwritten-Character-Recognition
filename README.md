# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
The Handwriting Recognition System is an AI-based application designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits or characters. This system leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to accurately identify and interpret handwritten text. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits, and can be extended to recognize other handwritten characters or symbols.

The core functionality of the system includes:

Image Preprocessing: The system receives an image of handwritten text, preprocesses it by converting it into grayscale, applying thresholding for better contrast, and resizing it to match the input dimensions required by the model.

Model Training: The system utilizes a CNN model, which is trained using labeled images of handwritten digits (from the MNIST dataset) to learn the patterns and features of each digit.

Prediction: Once the model is trained, it can predict the digit or character from any new handwritten image. It returns the recognized digit and provides the softmax probabilities for each possible class, allowing users to interpret the confidence level of the prediction.

Deployment: The system is deployed as a web application using Flask, where users can upload an image of handwritten text (in base64 format) and receive a prediction via a RESTful API.

This project demonstrates the ability to leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques for recognizing handwritten digits and can be adapted to support different languages, fonts, or more complex handwriting styles.

Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow (Keras)

Flask (for web deployment)

MNIST dataset

PIL (Pillow) for image processing

OpenCV (optional for advanced preprocessing)

Use Cases:

Automatic number plate recognition (in the case of digits)

Digit recognition in forms or checks

Assistive technology for the visually impaired

This project serves as a fundamental example of handwriting recognition, which can be extended and applied to various real-world applications where recognizing handwritten information is crucial.
